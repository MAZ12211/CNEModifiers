<!--
	I didn't like changing these options through options instead of a more convinent way (freeplay)
	thus why this file is definitely intentionally misnamed and definitely not because it wasn't bugged at the time of scripting this
	The About section of this forked repo says "Will visit this later", but I didn't realize how longer "later" would take
	and considering that the main modifiers repo is gone for some reason, I decided to fix this up (+ I want to play some songs with higher speed lmao)

	I may have a few ideas for this, but honestly,
	considering that V Slice is objectivly a better way to play
	the game in my opinion (Input isn't too strict like Kade but it isn't toddler level like Psych or CNE. It simply feels way better to play and official),
	I can't say I'll maintain this repo anymore.

	That said there's still mods that use this engine for example Grieving Day In Funkin that released almost a week ago.
	So take what I said about implementing ideas with a grain of salt.
