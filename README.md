# Modifiers for Codename Engine

A forked repo from syrup's CNEModifiers
This is an addon for Codename Engine that adds modifiers to spice up the game!
Tested on `a3d9ddb`.

## Showcase

## Features

- Playback Rate
  - Can be in freeplay using `SHIFT + E/Q` or `SHIFT + Mouse Scroll`.
- Botplay
  - Can be enabled/disabled in pause menu just like base game.

## Installation Guide

1. If not done already, make a folder called "addons" (without the quotes)
2. Extract the files in the addons folder
3. Enjoy
Depending on the mod's scale, this has the potential to break it. So use this at your own caution.

## Known Issues

- The song sometimes freezes when reaching its' end. (I have no clue how to fix it sorry)
